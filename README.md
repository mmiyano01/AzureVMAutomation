# AzureVMAutomation

Web automation program to control virtul machine(s) on Azure Portal. 

## Getting Started

This python program will automatically start virtul machine(s) on Azure Portal with using Selenium. 
So far, it only has function to start the vm, but eventually I will add more functions (such as stop vm).

### Prerequisites
